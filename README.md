# raylib-nuklear

Implementation of [Nuklear](https://github.com/vurtun/nuklear) for the [raylib](http://www.raylib.com/) game engine.

Very much a work in progress. Not all features of nuklear have been implemented yet, though basic window creation seems to be working along with mouse input handling. I will work to get a feature completion list on here soon.
